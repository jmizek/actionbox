README file
-----------

To play game *, download python 2.x from Python.org (I'm using 2.6.6, hopefully this works with 2.7.2)
Now download and install pygame from pygame.org
if your python installation came with IDLE:
	Open IDLE
	Do File > Open... > *.py
	Run (F5)
else:
	Add python to your path, if it isn't already there
	Open a command prompt and run python on *.py
